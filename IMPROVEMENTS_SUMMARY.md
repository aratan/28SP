  - Configurable cache size and expiration
  - Automatic cleanup of expired entries
  - Thread-safe operations
  - Cache statistics monitoring

### 5.2. Connection Pooling
- Created connection pooling mechanism (`internal/pool/connection_pool.go`):
  - Reuse of libp2p connections
  - Configurable pool size and idle timeouts
  - Automatic cleanup of idle connections
  - Connection health checking
  - Pool statistics monitoring

## 6. Additional Improvements
